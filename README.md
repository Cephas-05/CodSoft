# 1. Chatbot with Rule-Based-Response:
This project features a straightforward rule-based chatbot coded in Python. The bot chats with users by replying to different prompts like greetings, identity questions, jokes, weather inquiries, and more. Responses are predefined, triggered by keywords or phrases in user input. The script leverages basic Python functions to capture, process input with conditionals, and generate fitting replies. Users can chat with the bot until they type 'bye' to end. The code is extendable and customizable for enhanced chatbot functionality and smarter responses.

# 2. Recommendation System in Python:
A movie recommendation system uses user ratings and movie data to suggest films. By employing collaborative filtering, it predicts a user's rating for unseen movies based on similarities with other users or movies. The system processes this data with algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or matrix factorization. It then generates personalized movie recommendations, helping users discover films they are likely to enjoy.

# 3. Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game:

This Python program creates a Tic Tac Toe game using Tkinter for the GUI. Players can choose between single-player (against the computer) or multiplayer modes. It features a Minimax algorithm for optimal AI moves in single-player mode. The game checks for wins or draws and allows restarting, updating the board dynamically based on player actions.
