A movie recommendation system uses user ratings and movie data to suggest films. By employing collaborative filtering, it predicts a user's rating for unseen movies based on similarities with other users or movies. The system processes this data with algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or matrix factorization. It then generates personalized movie recommendations, helping users discover films they are likely to enjoy.
